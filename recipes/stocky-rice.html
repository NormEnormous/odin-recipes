    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        
        <ul>
         
            <li><strong>Your</strong> favorite rice. Mine is basmati.</li>
            <li>Soup stock of your choice. Mine is chicken.</li>
            <li>Fresh onions</li>
            <li>Rice cooker</li>
            
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    
        <ol>
 
            <li><strong>Wash your rice.</strong> Seriously, wash your rice. 3 times at least, or until the water runs <strong><em>CLEAR</em></strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Measure your water.</strong> Remember how much rice you washed, your rice cooker should have lines to show you how much water to add. Add that much <b>HOT</b> water.</li> 
            <li><strong>Dissolve stock.</strong> Stir your stock around in the hot water until dissolved.</li>
            <li><strong>Add rice.</strong> Add your <b><i>WASHED</i></b> rice to the soup stock water.</li>
            <li><strong>Wait.</strong> Turn on your rice cooker and wait! It does the cooking for you!</li>
            <li><strong>Enjoy!</strong> After 20 minutes or so, your rice will be done! Be careful though, it's hot, so let it sit for a few minutes before you eat.</li>

        </ol>
