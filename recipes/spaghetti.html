        <ol>
 
            <li><strong>Crush your tomatoes.</strong> We want a fine paste, there's a reason ma could slap you so hard, <em>that's because she worked so hard crushing these tomatoes</em></li>
            <li><strong>Cook bacon.</strong> Cook your bacon, we want it still soft. <b>Keep the pan fat.</b></li> 
            <li><strong>Cook ground meat.</strong> Cook your ground meat <i>in</i> the pan fat. Add some salt, garlic and onion as well.</li>
            <li><strong>Boil the tomato paste.</strong> We want our paste <b><em>slightly</em></b> rolling.</li>
            <li><strong>Add seasoning and meat.</strong> Add garlic, onion, basil, parsley, 1 bayleaf per person, chili flakes and meat to the sauce.</li>
            <li><strong>Simmer the sauce.</strong> Turn down the heat to a simmer, stirring frequently. Allow to cook for another 2 hours.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook spaghetti.</strong> Add salt to a large pot, boil. Cook spaghetti for 10-12 minutes or until soft.</li>
            <li><strong>Strain spaghetti.</strong> Strain the spaghetti of water, keep up to 1 cup of water depending on the desired thickness of sauce.</li>
            <li><strong>Add water to sauce, and sauce to spaghetti.</strong> You can add some water to change the consistency of the sauce. Add the sauce to the spaghetti, and mix together.</li>
            <li><strong>Enjoy!</strong> Hopefully you get a bay-leaf for goodluck! Should last in the fridge for up to 6 days.</li>
